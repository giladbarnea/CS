Prove:   
AΔB⊆D ∧ BΔC⊆D → AΔC⊆D

Since (X→Z) ∧ (Y→Z) ≡ (X∨Y)→Z, also:  
(AΔB⊆D ∧ BΔC⊆D) ≡ (AΔB ∪ BΔC) ⊆ D. Proof:

I'll prove that AΔC ⊆ (AΔB ∪ BΔC), then it wo∪ld follow by transience that AΔC⊆C

Define:   
P = B; Q = (A∪C); R = (<over>A</over>∪<over>C</over>)  
  
So proving Q∧R → (¬P∨Q ∨ P∧R),  
will prove that AΔC ⊆ (AΔB ∪ BΔC)

Proving Q∧R → (¬P∨Q ∨ P∧R) is always tr∪e:  
Premise: (Q∧R); Conclusion: (¬P∨Q ∨ P∧R).  
Premise → Conclusion is always tr∪e if the following holds:  
Whenever the Premise is tr∪e, also the Conclusion is tr∪e.  
Assuming that Premise is tr∪e:  
Q∧R ≡ 𝚻 ⟹   
Q≡𝚻 ∧ R≡𝚻  
Using that in the Conclusion:  
(¬P∨Q ∨ P∧R) ≡ (¬P∨𝚻 ∨ P∧𝚻) ≡ ¬P∨P ≡ 𝚻  
Therefore the conclusion is dependent ∪pon the premise, therefore   
__Q∧R → (¬P∨Q ∨ P∧R) ≡ 𝚻__ <comment>(4)  </comment>

P, Q and R are placeholders (defined above), so I'll ∪se their "real" val∪es:  
Q∧R → (¬P∨Q ∨ P∧R) ≡  
  
(A∪C)∩(<over>A</over>∪<over>C</over>) → [<over>B</over>∩(A∪C)] ∪ [B∩(<over>A</over>∪<over>C</over>)]  
<grey>Using (3):  </grey>

AΔC ⊆ [<over>B</over>∩(A∪C)] ∪ [B∩(<over>A</over>∪<over>C</over>)]  
<grey>Using (2):  </grey>

Since it's given that:  
AΔB⊆D ∧ BΔC⊆D  
Using (1), it's eq∪ivalent to:  
(AΔB ∪ BΔC) ⊆ D  
And because of (5), we know that   
AΔC ⊆ (AΔB ∪ BΔC)  
Together with the transience of ⊆, <comment>X⊆Y and Y⊆Z ⇒ X⊆Z  </comment>

M: 𝓟({1,2,3})  
𝑹: ⟨A,B⟩∈𝑹 ⟺ AΔB⊆{1,2}  
𝑺: ⟨A,B⟩∈𝑺 ⟺ AΔ{1,2} ⊂ BΔ{1,2}

𝑹 is the equivalence relation because it's reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

Reflexive: if 𝑹 is reflexive then AΔA⊆{1,2}.  
The symmetric difference between anything and itself is ∅ ⟹ AΔA = ∅.      
∅ is a subset of every possible set ⟹ ∅⊆{1,2} ⟹ __AΔA⊆{1,2}__

Symmetric: if 𝑹 is symmetric then AΔB⊆{1,2} → BΔA⊆{1,2}.    
Symmetric difference is commutative: XΔY ≡ YΔX for any X,Y.  
Therefore AΔB ≡ BΔA ⟹ __AΔB⊆{1,2} → BΔA⊆{1,2}__

Transitive: if 𝑹 is transitive then AΔB⊆{1,2} ∧ BΔC⊆{1,2} → AΔC⊆{1,2}.  
We proved in 2א that __AΔB⊆D ∧ BΔC⊆D → AΔC⊆D__

The equivalence classes of 𝑹:

⟦∅⟧ is the set containing all elements in M such that {m∈M | ⟨m,0⟩∈𝑹}}.  
Remembering that for any X, the following is true: XΔ∅ = X;  
Therefore, using the definition of 𝑹: 

__⟦∅⟧__ = {m∈M | mΔ∅ ⊆ {1,2}} = {m∈M | m ⊆ {1,2}} = __{∅, {1}, {2}, {1,2}}__

 

We are left with four subsets: {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}.  
Because {3} is a subset of each of them, let's figure out it's equivalence class.  
⟦3⟧ = {m∈M | mΔ{3} ⊆ {1,2}}  
Because symmetric difference leaves out everything besides the intersection, m has to contain {3} if we need mΔ{3}⊆{1,2} to be true, so:  
{3} ⊆ m
